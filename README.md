# IPL-team-win-probability-predictor
This project predicts the winning probability of an IPL team at any given ball in a match using Machine Learning (Logistic Regression). The model dynamically updates the probability based on real-time match data, providing insights into the likelihood of victory as the game progresses.
# **Key Features**
âœ” Predicts win probability after every ball in an IPL match
âœ” Uses Logistic Regression to calculate probabilities
âœ” Analyzes key match factors such as runs, wickets, overs, and required run rate
âœ” Provides real-time match insights with data-driven predictions
# **Methodology**
ðŸ”¹ Dataset: Historical IPL match data (including ball-by-ball statistics)
ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering: Selection of crucial match parameters affecting game outcome
ðŸ”¹ Model Used: Logistic Regression for probability estimation
ðŸ”¹ Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, and recall
# **Results & Future Scope**
âœ… The model provides reliable predictions for IPL matches based on ball-by-ball data.
âœ… Accuracy is evaluated against historical IPL matches.
# **Future Enhancements:**
Incorporate advanced ML models (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks)
Use real-time match data streaming for live predictions
